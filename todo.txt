TODO

- think about warning/control bounds very thorougly
- overwork set-git-version backbone
- implement first precise generate_xxx_chart function for X-Bar chart (keep in mind to figure out a nice architecture for warning_bounds_generator and control_bounds_generator)
- add autoplot method to "replace" simple plot Function
